# car-detection-yolo

## Introduction:
The aim of this project was to develop a car detection system using the YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection algorithm. The project utilized a dataset obtained from Coursera, containing labeled images of cars for training the model. YOLO is a state-of-the-art real-time object detection system that is efficient and accurate.

## Methodology:

Data Collection: The dataset used in this project was obtained from Coursera, which provided a sufficient number of labeled images of cars for training purposes.

Model Selection: YOLOv2, a popular variant of the YOLO algorithm, was chosen as the model architecture due to its balance between speed and accuracy. Instead of training the model from scratch, a pre-trained YOLOv2 model was utilized. This pre-trained model had been trained on a large-scale dataset, enabling it to learn rich feature representations that could be fine-tuned for car detection.

## Conclusion:
In conclusion, the project successfully implemented a car detection system using the YOLO algorithm. By utilizing a pre-trained YOLOv2 model and a car dataset from Coursera, we were able to develop an accurate and efficient car detection model. This project highlights the effectiveness of transfer learning in leveraging pre-existing knowledge from large-scale datasets to solve specific object detection tasks. Moving forward, the trained model could be deployed in various applications such as traffic monitoring, autonomous driving, and parking assistance systems. Further improvements could be made by fine-tuning the model on additional car datasets and optimizing hyperparameters for specific use cases.
